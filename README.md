## üìä Dataset Information

- **Name:** `Fraud.csv`
- **Size:** ~400MB
- **Description:** An anonymized transactional dataset with labeled fraudulent and non-fraudulent instances.
- **Shape:** Rows = N (actual rows vary), Columns = Features like amount, time, class, etc.
- **Target Column:** `Class` (1 = Fraud, 0 = Legitimate)

> ‚ùó **Note:** The dataset is **NOT included** in this repo due to GitHub‚Äôs 100MB file size limit. Please follow the instructions below to download and use the data.

## üì• Download Dataset

Upload your dataset to any of these:
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/)
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)

Then use the following Python script to download it automatically (example for Google Drive):

### ‚û§ download_data.py

```python
import gdown

url = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=YOUR_FILE_ID'
output = 'data/Fraud.csv'

gdown.download(url, output, quiet=False)
```

To run:
```bash
pip install gdown
python download_data.py
```

> üìÅ After download, ensure the file is placed inside the `data/` directory.

## üß† Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Correlation matrix  
   - Class imbalance visualization  
   - Feature distributions

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing data  
   - Feature scaling (e.g., MinMaxScaler)  
   - Encoding categorical variables (if any)

3. **Modeling**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Other classifiers (optionally)

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - ROC-AUC Curve

5. **Handling Imbalanced Data (Optional)**  
   - SMOTE / Oversampling  
   - Undersampling  
   - Class weights

## üßº Git LFS Instructions (Optional)

If you plan to track large files using Git LFS:

1. Install Git LFS:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```

2. Track the file:
   ```bash
   git lfs track "data/Fraud.csv"
   ```

3. Add, commit, and push:
   ```bash
   git add .gitattributes data/Fraud.csv
   git commit -m "Add large dataset via Git LFS"
   git push origin main
   ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to remove previous versions of large files from commit history if pushing fails.
