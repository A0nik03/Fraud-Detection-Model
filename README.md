# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Fraud Detection Model

Detecting fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning techniques.

This project presents a robust pipeline for analyzing, processing, and classifying fraud-related data using a supervised machine learning approach. It aims to uncover suspicious patterns and improve the security of financial systems.

## üìä Dataset Information

- **Name:** `Fraud.csv`
- **Size:** ~400MB
- **Description:** An anonymized transactional dataset with labeled fraudulent and non-fraudulent instances.
- **Shape:** Rows = N (actual rows vary), Columns = Features like amount, time, class, etc.
- **Target Column:** `Class` (1 = Fraud, 0 = Legitimate)

> ‚ùó **Note:** The dataset is **NOT included** in this repo due to GitHub‚Äôs 100MB file size limit. Please follow the instructions below to download and use the data.

## üì• Download Dataset

Upload your dataset to from here:
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11TNTzTc9VmTLkgTp5ClMFkEfCPXAaA_V?usp=sharing)

Then use the following Python script to download it automatically (example for Google Drive):

### ‚û§ Features

- **`step`**  
  Represents a unit of time, where **1 step = 1 hour**. The dataset spans **744 steps** (i.e., 30 days).

- **`type`**  
  Type of transaction. It can be one of the following:  
  `CASH-IN`, `CASH-OUT`, `DEBIT`, `PAYMENT`, or `TRANSFER`.

- **`amount`**  
  The value of the transaction, measured in local currency.

- **`nameOrig`**  
  The ID of the person or account that **initiated** the transaction.

- **`oldbalanceOrg`**  
  The sender's account balance **before** the transaction took place.

- **`newbalanceOrig`**  
  The sender's account balance **after** the transaction.

- **`nameDest`**  
  The ID of the person or account **receiving** the transaction.

- **`oldbalanceDest`**  
  The recipient‚Äôs account balance **before** the transaction.  
  *Note: For recipients whose IDs start with "M" (merchants), this value may be unavailable.*

- **`newbalanceDest`**  
  The recipient‚Äôs account balance **after** the transaction.  
  *Again, may be missing for merchants.*

- **`isFraud`**  
  Indicates whether the transaction is **fraudulent (`1`)** or **legitimate (`0`)**. Fraudulent activity often involves unauthorized transfers and cash-outs.

- **`isFlaggedFraud`**  
  Flags transactions that **violate fraud detection rules** ‚Äî in this dataset, any `TRANSFER` over **200,000** units is flagged as suspicious.

## üß† Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Correlation matrix  
   - Class imbalance visualization  
   - Feature distributions

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing data  
   - Feature scaling (e.g., MinMaxScaler)  
   - Encoding categorical variables (if any)

3. **Modeling**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Other classifiers (optionally)

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - ROC-AUC Curve

5. **Handling Imbalanced Data (Optional)**  
   - SMOTE / Oversampling  
   - Undersampling  
   - Class weights
